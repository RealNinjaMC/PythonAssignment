# PythonAssignment

A small collection of Python assignment scripts and example inputs. These are simple, self-contained programs used to practice basic Python programming concepts (file I/O, calculations, control flow, and simple tests).

**Repository Contents**
- `empl_salary.py`: Calculate employee salary / payroll-related computations.
- `grade.py`: Compute student grades or grade-related logic.
- `hosting.py`: Small script related to hosting calculations or examples.
- `math_stuff.py`: Utility math functions used by other scripts or tests.
- `math_test.py`: Simple test harness for `math_stuff.py` (run to validate math helpers).
- `purchase_calc.py`: Read purchase data from text files and compute totals.
- `purchase-1.txt`, `purchase-2.txt`: Example input files for `purchase_calc.py`.
- `traffic_speed.py`: Calculate speed/duration/distance related problems.
- `travel_advice.py`: Simple travel advice or routing examples.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or newer.

**How to run**
- Run a script directly with Python. Example:

```
python math_test.py
```

- If a script expects an input file, pass the filename as an argument. Example (if supported by the script):

```
python purchase_calc.py purchase-1.txt
```
